## 📋 What is EelJet?

EelJet is a deployment platform that takes your code from GitHub and puts it live on the web. No server configuration, no SSL certificates to manage, no complex setups - just connect your repository and deploy.

### How It Works

1. **Connect** - Sign in with GitHub and select your repository
2. **Configure** - Choose your subdomain and add environment variables
3. **Deploy** - Click deploy and watch your app go live
4. **Manage** - Control deployments, view logs, and update anytime

Your app will be accessible at `yourapp.eeljet.com` with HTTPS automatically configured.

## ✨ Features

### Simple Deployment

- **GitHub Integration** - Import any repository with one click
- **Auto-Detection** - Automatically detects build configuration
- **Zero Config** - No configuration files needed
- **Instant HTTPS** - Every deployment includes SSL certificate

### Environment Management

- **Secure Variables** - Encrypted environment variable storage
- **Easy Input** - Paste your entire `.env` file or add variables individually
- **Build & Runtime** - Variables available during build and at runtime
- **Update Anytime** - Modify and redeploy without rebuilding

### Deployment Control

- **Real-Time Logs** - Watch your deployment happen live
- **Quick Redeploy** - Rebuild and restart with one click
- **Deployment History** - Track all deployments and changes
- **Easy Rollback** - Return to previous versions instantly

### Subdomain Management

- **Custom Subdomains** - Pick any available name

### Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- A web application in a GitHub repository

### Deploy Your First App

1. **Sign Up**
   - Visit [eeljet.com](https://eeljet.com)
   - Sign in with your GitHub account
   - Authorize EelJet to access your repositories

2. **Import Repository**
   - Click "New Deployment"
   - Select repository from the list
   - Choose branch to deploy

3. **Configure Deployment**
   - Pick a subdomain: `myapp.eeljet.com`
   - Add environment variables (optional)
   - Review configuration

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Watch real-time deployment logs

### Example Deployment

```bash
$ eeljet deploy my-web-app

✓ Repository cloned from github.com/username/my-web-app
✓ Branch: main @ commit 3f2a1b9
✓ Dependencies installed with pnpm
✓ Environment variables configured
✓ Build completed in 12.3s
✓ Application started successfully
✓ SSL certificate issued
✓ DNS configured

🎉 Deployment successful!
🌐 Live at: https://my-web-app.eeljet.com
```

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Environment variables are securely stored and injected during deployment.

### Adding Variables

**Option 1: Paste `.env` file**

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db
API_KEY=your-api-key
SECRET_KEY=your-secret
```

**Option 2: Add individually**

- Variable name: `DATABASE_URL`
- Variable value: `postgresql://...`

### Variable Security

- All variables encrypted at rest
- Never exposed in logs or dashboard
- Accessible only to your deployment
- Updated independently of code

## 📊 Dashboard

### App Overview

- View all deployed applications
- Check deployment status
- Monitor uptime and health
- Quick access to app URLs

### Deployment History

- Complete deployment timeline
- Build logs for each deployment
- Success/failure status
- Deployment duration and details

### App Management

- **Redeploy** - Rebuild from latest code
- **Restart** - Quick restart without rebuild
- **Stop** - Pause application
- **Delete** - Remove deployment and free subdomain

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment

### Auto-Deploy

Enable automatic deployments when you push to GitHub:

1. Go to your app settings
2. Enable "Auto-Deploy on Push"
3. Select branches to watch
4. Push to GitHub - EelJet deploys automatically

### Manual Deploy

Trigger deployments manually from the dashboard anytime.
